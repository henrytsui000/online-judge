and make new friends. Uiharu and her friends are red team.

And each one in white team will pick one of red team's members as students. 
Everyone will pick a student and can only be one person's student. 
First, red team will teach their students their own skill. 
And white team will teach their students their own skill. 
Everyone learn one new skill now. 
Then red team will teach their students the new skill they just learned and 
so does white team. 
This won't stop until they cannot learn new skill.

Both red team and white team have $N$ people. 
$M$ people already choose a student.
Uiharu wonders how many possibilities are left so everyone could 
learn all the skill the attendee has. Can you help her?

Two possibility are considered different if anyone choose a different student.
