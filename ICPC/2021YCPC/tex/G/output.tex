Print $n$ floating number, the $i$-th number indicates the minimal length of 
fences if Alice wants to use the $i$-th  wood pile as one of the vertices in 
her garden.
If it is impossible to fence up her garden with the $i$-th wood pile, 
please print $-1$.
The answer is considered as correct if its absolute or relative error 
doesn't exceed $10^{âˆ’6}$.
Namely, if your answer is $a$, and the jury's answer is $b$, 
then your answer is accepted, if $\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,|b|)}\leq 10^{-6}$
