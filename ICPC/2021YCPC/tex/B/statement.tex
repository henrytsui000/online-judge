You are given a string $s = s_1 s_2 s_3 ... s_n$.
Let $f(s,i)$ denotes the starting position of the best length-$i$ substring.
For two equal-length substring $a$ and $b$, the one has smaller lexicographically order is better.
If the two substring are the same, the one has smaller starting position is better.

Let $h(s) = \sum_{i=1}^n i \times f(s, i)$.
Your task is to find $h(s)$.
