The first line contains two space-separated positive integers $n$ and $m$.
$n$ is the number of edges of the simple polygon, and 
$m$ is the number of points. Then $n+m$ lines follow.
For $1\le i\le n$, the $(i+1)$-th line of the input contains two 
space-separated integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ where $v_i=(x_i,y_i)$ is the
$i$-th item of the sequence describing the simple polygon.
For $1\le j\le m$, the $(1+n+j)$-th line of the input contains two
space-separated integers $X_j$ and $Y_j$ where $p_j=(X_j,Y_j)$ is the $j$-th
point to be tested whether it is covered by the simple polygon.
