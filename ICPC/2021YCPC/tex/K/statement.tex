There is an epidemic of KOVID-21 spreading around the world.
People's lives are severely affected by the KOVID-21. 
Especially the people like to travel around the world.

Fortunately, the vaccine, Hoderna, is coming.
Hoderna is so powerful that the person who has been vaccinated with Horderna will not be infected with KOVID-21 at all.
But Hoderna is hard to preserve. 
For convenience, the government wants to find \emph{exactly one} place to be a vaccination station.
Finding the place of the vaccination station is a hard problem.
If the place of the vaccination station is too far for some person. 
They will be annoyed with the government.

The country is a 2D plane, there are $n$ residents.
The $i$th resident lives on the $(x_i,y_i)$ of the 2D plane.
Guarantee the residents live in the integer position, which means $x_i,y_i$ are integers.
In one unit, the person in the position $(x,y)$ can go to one of the eight position
$(x-1,y-1),(x-1,y),(x-1,y+1),(x,y-1),(x,y+1),(x+1,y-1),(x+1,y),(x+1,y+1)$.
The annoy value of a resident is the number of time units that he needs to spend to go to the vaccination station from their home.
Please help the government to \emph{minimize} the \emph{sum} of annoyance with all residents.
