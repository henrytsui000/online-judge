Uiharu and Misaka are running a barbershop. 
There are $N$ customers every day. 
Everyone wants a different hair style so the work load $w_i$ would be different.
Uiharu and Misaka have different skills to speed up their work. 
Uiharu could program the hair clipper to work faster. 
She can finish $U$ unit of work per second. 
Misaka could control the electricity and operate the hair clipper without hands.
She can finish $M$ unit of work per second. 
Each customer can only be serviced by one barber. 
Uiharu and Misaka want to getting off work together. 
They'll go home after the last customer leave. 
They need to distribute the work load evenly. 
Right now, they are busy on preparing their equipment. 
Can you help them find out what is the least time to finish today's work? 
If the last customer leaves in the middle of a second, 
we say the work finishes at the end of the second.
