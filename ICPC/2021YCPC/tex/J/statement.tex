Juniper Networks, Inc. is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.
The company develops and markets networking products,

Aston Martin Lagonda, one of the most prestigious British sport car brands,

empowering automotive designers and engineers to build new iconic British cars.
Consistent network infrastructure supports diverse requirements at offices,
manufacturing facilities, engineering centers, and performance centers.
The simplicity of Juniper empowers the IT team to operate at the speed of business.

The network company has developed a new routing system,
where there are $n$ routers indexed from $1$ to $n$.
Each router is protected by two keys $P_i$ and $Q_i$.
To initialize the system, the terminal has to send packets to unlock the routers sequentially..
A packet holding two keys is sent from the terminal each time,
which is able to unlock any number of the remaining routers matching at least one key value.
As a professional computer scientist, you are asked to minimalize the network usage for the system.
Given the keys on each router, determine the minimum number of packets needed to initialize to system.
