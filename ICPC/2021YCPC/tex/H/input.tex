The first line contains three space-separated positive integers 
$n$, $m$ and $d$.
$n$ is the number of the labeled samples in the training data. 
$m$ is the number of the labeled samples in the testing data.
$d$ is the dimension of the labeled samples.
Then $n+m$ lines follow. 
Each of the first $n$ of them represents a labeled sample in 
the training data, and each the last $m$ of them represents a 
labeled sample in the testing data.
Every labeled sample is a line containing $d+1$ space-separated positive
integers $t,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d$.
